GWT SymbolMap is a library for reading the `*.symbolMap` files produced by the GWT compiler and asserting the
state of the symbol map. It is primarily used to verify that the compiled output contains the expected symbols
given a permutation and/or compile time configuration properties.

The code base has yet to develop useful documentation. For the source code and project support please visit
the [GitHub project](https://github.com/realityforge/gwt-symbolmap).
